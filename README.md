# Java Language Server Indexer

## Language Server Index Format

The purpose of the Language Server Index Format (LSIF) is to define a standard format for language servers or other programming tools to dump their knowledge about a workspace. This dump can later be used to answer language server [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) requests for the same workspace without running the language server itself. Since much of the information would be invalidated by a change to the workspace, the dumped information typically excludes requests used when mutating a document. So, for example, the result of a code complete request is typically not part of such a dump.

A first draft specification can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/indexFormat/specification.md).
